# CiberProjects

Welcome to the **CiberProjects** repository! This repository contains various cybersecurity-related projects that I've developed as part of my academic and professional journey.

## Projects

### 1. Email Phishing Detection
**Description**:  
This project focuses on detecting phishing emails using machine learning techniques. I built models to classify emails as phishing or legitimate, leveraging both traditional machine learning algorithms and advanced NLP models like RoBERTa.

**Key Features**:
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction from email datasets.
- Machine Learning models (Random Forest, SVM).
- NLP-based deep learning models (RoBERTa).
- Evaluation metrics for model comparison.

**Goal**:  
Enhance email security by accurately identifying phishing attempts.

### 2. Radcom Competition
**Description**:  
This project was developed for the **Radcom cybersecurity competition**. It focuses on analyzing network traffic to detect potential threats or anomalies. The goal was to apply real-world cybersecurity skills in a competitive environment.

**Key Features**:
- Network traffic analysis using tools like Wireshark/tshark.
- Feature engineering on captured packets (e.g., packet size, flow, latency).
- Anomaly detection and classification.

**Goal**:  
Improve network security posture by identifying suspicious patterns in traffic.
